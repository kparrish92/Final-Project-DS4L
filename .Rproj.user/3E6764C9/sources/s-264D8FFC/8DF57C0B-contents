This is what the steps for a proposal might look for many...

# Research Idea

--

- I wanted to:

 - relate this project to another proposal I am developing
 
 - include a sociolinguistics component

--

- Codeswitching (CS) among Romanian-Spanish bilinguals in Spain
 
--
 
 - I will look at four variables: 
 
     - Frequency of CS, 
     
     - Generation Status,
     
     - Proficiency in Romanian(1),
     
     - Gender
     
(1) I am looking only at Proficiency in Romanian to align with Torres and Potowski's (2016) methodology.
---
#Background information

--

- CS - the practice of using more than one language or language variety in discourse (Poplack, 1980)

- Although CS is a prevalent practice in bilingual communities, it falls under *nonstandardized language practices* and it is often stigmatized.

- large community of Romanians in Spain 
 -  Romanian-Spanish bilingualism is prevalent
 
- studies on Romanian-Spanish bilinguals in Spain are scarce

--

- **Labov' Gender Paradox**

 - a sociolinguistic phenomenon 
  - Women conform more closely than men to sociolinguistic norms that are overtly prescribed, but conform less than men when they are not. 
  - Women are more likely to use prestige forms and avoid stigmatized variants than men for a majority of linguistic variables, but that they are also more likely to lead language change by using innovative forms of variables.

---
#Disclaimer

--

While I acknowledge that gender is fluid, for the purposes of this proposal, I am limiting myself to traditional dichotomies of gender (male/female) in order to be able to test the predictions of the Gender Paradox.

--

More research that includes gender-non-conforming participants is highly needed!

---
#Research Questions

--

**RQ 1.** Does gender influence frequency of CS?

--

**RQ 2.** Does generation status influence frequency of CS?

--

**RQ 3.** Does proficiency in Romanian influence frequency of CS?

#Methodology (1)
--

## Participants

- two generations of Romanian-Spanish bilinguals 

 - Generation 1 (G1) bilinguals: born in Romania and immigrated to Spain as adults (i.e., after age 18)
 
 - Generation 2 (G2) bilinguals: born to at least one G1 parent
 
     - born in Spain
     
     - born in Romania and immigrated to Spain before age 9 (see Torres & Potowski, 2016)

#Methodology (2)

##Tasks

- In order to assess participants' CS frequency, they will take the Assessment of Code-Switching Experience Survey (ACSES; Blackburn, 2013)
 - They will be divided into *High* frequency code-switchers and *Low* frequency code-switchers

- Participants' proficiency will be assessed via the Boston Naming Test (BNT; Kaplan, Goodglass, and Weintraub, 1983) in both Romanian and Spanish. 
 - The BNT contains 60 outline drawings of objects and animals, which I will divide into two blocks, a Romanian one and a Spanish one, with thirty images per block (see Guzzardo-Tamargo et al., 2016, for a similar methodology regarding the administration of the BNT).
 
- Participants will also complete a **Language History Questionnaire**.

#Descriptive Statistics for Sample

--

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
Data<-read.csv(here("Data", "Data_Raw", "Dataset_Raw.csv"))

Descriptive<-Data %>% 
  group_by(Generation) %>%  
  summarize(mean_Proficiency=mean(Proficiency), sd_Proficiency=sd(Proficiency),
            range_Proficiency=range(Proficiency))

knitr::kable(head(Descriptive), format="html")

```
